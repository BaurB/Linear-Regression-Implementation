# Linear-Regression-Implementation
The Jupyter Notebook includes implementation of closed-form solution of Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient. Notebook can be divided into thee sub-headings: 
*  Code has simple implementation of Linear Hypothesis function and Mean Squared Error function. I have also included a small csv to compare the outut of implemented MSE function with the standard sklearn.metrics MSE function. The results were identical which means that the implementation is correct
*  Closed-Form Solution is implemented using the Normal Equation
*  Gradient Descent includes Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent
